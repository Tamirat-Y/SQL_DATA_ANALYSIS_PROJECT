# background

Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from my SQL Course. It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used 

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1.  Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT	
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range**: Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers**: Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety**: There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
o understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT	
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:
